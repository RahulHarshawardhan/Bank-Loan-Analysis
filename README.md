This project leveraged Tableau to conduct a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of loan disbursement by a bank. By creating interactive dashboards, I provided stakeholders with crucial insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

Total Loan Applications: Track overall loan application volume.
Total Funded Amount: Analyze the total amount of loans disbursed.
Total Amount Received: Monitor loan repayment performance.
These insights empowered data-driven decision making for the bank.

Project Highlights:

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Ensured data accuracy by identifying and addressing inconsistencies, transforming it into a usable format for analysis.
Interactive Dashboards: Designed user-friendly dashboards equipped with filters and drill-down functionalities. These functionalities empower users to explore the data, uncover hidden patterns, and gain deeper understanding.
Data Visualization: Utilized Tableau's visualization capabilities to create impactful charts and graphs, highlighting trends and correlations within the loan data. Examples include:
Monthly Trends by Issue Date: A line chart depicting loan disbursement trends over time.
Regional Analysis by State: A filled map visualizing loan distribution across different regions.
Loan Term Analysis: A donut chart illustrating the breakdown of loan terms offered.
Good vs. Bad Loan Analysis: Analyzed and visualized the distribution of good and bad loans to understand credit performance and potential risks.
Enhanced Decision Making: This project provided stakeholders with a clear, comprehensive, and visually engaging view of loan data. This facilitated more informed decision-making, potentially leading to:
Strategic improvements in loan portfolio management
Increased operational efficiency in processing loan applications
By showcasing my expertise in data visualization and analytics, this project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic improvements and operational efficiencies.
